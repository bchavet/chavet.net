**Filling**

- Soften cream cheese – mix in 1 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. I usually mix the ingredients for about 2 minutes on medium speed.
- Roll out one canister of crescent rolls on bottom of 9x13 inch pan – seal the perforations. Spread cream cheese mixture over the crescent rolls. Roll out 2nd canister of crescent rolls on top of mixture sealing the perforations.

**Topping**

- Mix 1 cup of sugar with cinnamon – (I sprinkle cinnamon on the sugar until it turns sort of light brown.) Melt butter – spread butter over top layer of crescent rolls with pastry brush. Evenly spread the sugar/cinnamon mixture over the butter covering the top. Bake in 350° oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 5-10 minutes.
